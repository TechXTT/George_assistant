# George_assistant
## The most basic virtual assistant you've seen 


George is a virtual assistant of a new generation.
It's so basic and dumb that you won't believe it.

## Features

- Barely understanding english because of the stupid Google API (which is still the best)
- Answering on wake word (Guess which one)(Hint : it's George)
- Can give you global and local ip address if you are too lazy to get it yourself
- Opens programs one command (open)
- Calculates the most basic of math problems 

## Tech

George uses a number of python libraries

- [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition#readme) - Speech recognition using Google Cloud Speech API
- [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard
- [PyAudio](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) - PyAudio can easily use Python to play and record audio
- [ipify](https://github.com/rdegges/python-ipify) - ip address lookup system
- [pyttsx3](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3) - pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python

And of course George_assistant itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/TechXTT/George_assistant)
 on GitHub.
